# Sentiment-Analysis-
Unbiased sentiment analysis framework for political data on Twitter

Technologies and languages used: Python, Django, and HTML
Machine Learning algorithms: SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes (Comparative Analysis)

Data cleaning and preprocessing are done on Twitter data of seven major political parties in India.
Sentiment Analysis is performed by three different Machine Learning algorithms to study how algorithms perform on this particular type of data.
The result of sentiment analysis is further optimized by considering the impact of factors like Retweet Count, User Followers Count and user's bio/description.
